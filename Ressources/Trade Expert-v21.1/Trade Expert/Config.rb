#===============================================================================
#  The Trade Expert
#    by Luka S.J.
#
#  Provides an emulated experience of Wonder Trade, but uses the base stat total
#  of a Pokemon species to determine which Pokemon you'll obtain from the trade.
#  Includes dialogues to make the event more interesting when trading your Pokemon.
#  To use, simply call it in an event via the script command:
#      tradeExpert(margin)
#  where margin is a percentage value (from 0.0 to 1.0) that determines the
#  increase in upper and lower base stat total values for the traded Pokemon.
#  By default, it is set to 0.1; meaning that the Pokemon you recieve will be
#  in the base stat total range of within 90% - 110% of the base stat total of
#  the Pokemon you're giving up for trade. The 'margin' parameter can be
#  omitted.
#  Look at the 'def tradePokemon' if you want to customize the Pokemon you're
#  getting from the trade even further.
#
#  Enjoy the script, and make sure to give credit!
